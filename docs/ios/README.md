## What this is

This is an **unofficial iOS build of [OpenJKDF2](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/OpenJKDF2)**,
the open-source re-implementation of the Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II engine by
shinyquagsire23 (Max Thomas) and the OpenJKDF2 contributors. Upstream OpenJKDF2
can already be built for iOS. This build adds the parts you need to actually
play it on a phone:

- on-screen touch controls (move stick, look, buttons, a Force power wheel,
  quick save and quick load)
- a HUD that stays clear of rounded screen corners and the home bar
- sound fixes
- a ready-made (unsigned) `.ipa` that GitHub builds automatically

Please keep in mind:

- **It's experimental.** Expect bugs, and keep backups of your saves.
- **No game files are included.** You need your own copy of Jedi Knight from
  GOG or Steam. Nobody here can give you the game files, so please don't ask.
- **It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Lucasfilm, Disney or LucasArts.**
  It's also not an official OpenJKDF2 release. Please report problems with
  this build here, not to the OpenJKDF2 developers (see
  [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs)).

## What you need

- **An iPhone or iPad running iOS / iPadOS 18 or newer.** On iPhone that means an
  iPhone XS / XR or newer, including the iPhone SE (2nd generation) and later.
- **Your own copy of Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II**, installed on a
  computer, from
  [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_jedi_knight_dark_forces_ii) or
  [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/32380/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Knight_Dark_Forces_II/).
  The GOG version is a good choice: it's DRM-free and comes with the
  soundtrack as music files.
  **No Windows PC?** Both stores sell the game for Windows. On a Mac, GOG's
  offline installer (the `.exe` from your GOG library) can usually be unpacked
  with the free tool *innoextract*, but that hasn't been tested with this game.
- **A way to sideload an app** (install an app that isn't from the App Store).
  The free options need an Apple ID and, at least for setup, a Mac or Windows
  PC. See [2. Install the app](#2-install-the-app).
- **Free space on your phone** for the game files: about as much as the
  `Episode`, `Resource` and `MUSIC` folders take on your computer (check their
  size there).

**Mysteries of the Sith** (the expansion) hasn't been tested on iOS and isn't
supported in this release. The main menu's *Expansions & Mods* screen offers
*Install Mysteries of the Sith*, but please ignore it for now, and never copy
expansion files into `jk1`.

## 1. Get your game files ready

Find the folder Jedi Knight is installed in on your computer:

- **GOG:** the folder you installed the game to. In GOG Galaxy: select the
  game, open the settings menu next to Play, then *Manage installation* > *Show folder*.
- **Steam:** right-click the game in your Library, then *Manage* > *Browse local files*.

Inside it you need these folders and files. Capital letters don't matter
(`Episode` and `episode` both work), but the folder structure does:

| Folder | What's in it | Needed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `episode` | `JK1.gob`, `JK1CTF.gob`, `JK1MP.gob` | **Required** |
| `resource` | `Res1hi.gob`, `Res2.gob`, `jk_.cd` | **Required** |
| `resource/video` | the cutscenes (`.SMK` files) | Recommended: without it you get no cutscenes |
| `MUSIC` | the soundtrack (`Track12.ogg` ... `Track32.ogg` in the GOG version) | Recommended: without it there's no music. Copy it if your copy has it. |

The easiest thing is to copy the whole `Episode`, `Resource` and `MUSIC`
folders. You don't need `JK.EXE` or anything else from the game folder.

## 2. Install the app

### Download the .ipa

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/sithewok13-dev/First-repo-for-Claude-for-JKDF2/releases/latest)
and download `OpenJKDF2-iOS-unsigned.ipa` from its *Assets*. You can download it
on the phone in Safari (it goes to Files > Downloads) or on your computer,
depending on the tool you use below.

There is also an
["iOS latest build"](https://github.com/sithewok13-dev/First-repo-for-Claude-for-JKDF2/releases/tag/ios-latest)
pre-release. It's rebuilt automatically every time the code changes, so it
has the newest fixes, but it may also be broken. Use the latest release unless
you're testing a fix.

### Sign and install it

The `.ipa` is **unsigned**, and an iPhone only runs apps signed with an Apple
certificate, so you sign it yourself with a sideloading tool. Any tool that can
install your own `.ipa` file works. Some common free ones:

- **[AltStore](https://altstore.io)** (AltStore Classic). You install AltServer
  on a Mac or Windows PC and use it to put AltStore on your phone. Then in
  AltStore, go to *My Apps*, tap **+** and pick the `.ipa`. AltStore refreshes
  your apps over Wi-Fi when AltServer is running on your computer.
  (*AltStore PAL*, the EU app marketplace, is a different thing and can't
  install this file.)
- **[SideStore](https://sidestore.io)**. A version of AltStore that, after a
  one-time setup with a computer, signs and refreshes apps on the phone itself.
- **[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io)**. A Mac or Windows program: connect
  your phone, drop the `.ipa` in, sign in with your Apple ID, and it installs
  the app.

These tools ask for your **Apple ID and password**, because they sign the app
with it. They're widely used, but they're made by third parties, not Apple;
some people use a separate Apple ID just for sideloading. On Windows, AltServer
and Sideloadly also need Apple's iTunes and iCloud for Windows installed:
follow each tool's own setup instructions.

Other ways: an Apple Developer Program membership (Apple's paid account) lets you sign
apps for a year at a time, and there are third-party signing services. This
guide doesn't recommend any paid service. If you use one, it's your call
whether you trust it.

**With a free Apple ID, apps only stay signed for 7 days.** After that the app
won't open until you refresh it (AltStore and SideStore can do this for you)
or install it again with the same tool. Your game files and saves are kept
when you refresh. A free Apple ID can also only have 3 sideloaded apps
at a time (AltStore or SideStore itself counts as one).

The first time, iOS may ask for two more things:

- **Developer Mode:** go to *Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode*,
  turn it on, restart the phone, and confirm.
- **"Untrusted Developer":** go to *Settings > General > VPN & Device Management*,
  tap your Apple ID under *Developer App*, and tap *Trust*.

**Updating:** to install a newer version, sideload the new `.ipa` with the same tool and
Apple ID. It replaces the app and keeps your game files and saves. If you
switch to a different tool or Apple ID, iOS may install it as a separate
app with an empty folder. If that happens, open the new app once, copy
everything from the old app's `jk1` folder into the new app's `jk1` folder
in the Files app (see below), and only then delete the old app.

## 3. Copy the game files to your iPhone

1. **Open OpenJKDF2 once.** It will tell you the game files are missing and
   ask you to copy your installation into the app's "Documents folder", with a
   long path that ends in `Documents/jk1`. That's normal: it has just created
   its folder. In the Files app, the app's Documents folder is
   *On My iPhone > OpenJKDF2*, and your files go **one level deeper, inside
   `jk1`** (step 4). The app can't go any further without the files, so close
   it (swipe up from the bottom of the screen and swipe OpenJKDF2 away).
2. **Get the folders from step 1 onto your phone**, any way you like:
   iCloud Drive (or another cloud drive that shows up in the Files app), a USB
   stick, or a `.zip` file (for example, zip the folders on a Mac and AirDrop
   the `.zip` to your phone).
3. **Open the Files app** and go to *Browse > On My iPhone* (*On My iPad*)
   *> OpenJKDF2 > jk1*.
4. **Copy (or move) `Episode`, `Resource` and `MUSIC` into `jk1`.** For example,
   long-press a folder > *Copy*, then long-press an empty spot in `jk1` > *Paste*.
5. **Check that it looks like this**, with `episode` and `resource` directly
   inside `jk1` and not in another folder:

   ```
   On My iPhone
   └── OpenJKDF2
       └── jk1
           ├── episode
           │   ├── JK1.gob
           │   ├── JK1CTF.gob
           │   └── JK1MP.gob
           ├── resource
           │   ├── Res1hi.gob
           │   ├── Res2.gob
           │   ├── jk_.cd
           │   └── video        (cutscenes)
           └── MUSIC            (soundtrack)
   ```

   The game adds its own `player` folder (your player profile and saves),
   plus empty `mods` and `expansions` folders. Leave those alone.
6. **Open OpenJKDF2 again.**

Things to know:

- **Capital letters don't matter** for anything inside `jk1`. The game finds
  `Episode` or `episode`, and `RES2.GOB` or `Res2.gob`. But use the `jk1` folder
  the app made (all lower case). Don't make your own.
- **Using a .zip:** tapping a `.zip` in the Files app unpacks it. Unpacking can
  create an extra folder around your files. If so, move `Episode`,
  `Resource` and `MUSIC` out of it so they sit directly inside `jk1`.
- **With a cable instead:** on a Mac, open Finder, select your iPhone and go to
  the *Files* tab. On Windows, use the Apple Devices app (or iTunes) and its file sharing.
  Drag a folder named `jk1`, containing `episode`, `resource` and `MUSIC`, onto
  OpenJKDF2. If OpenJKDF2 already has a `jk1` folder, it may ask to replace
  it, and replacing it deletes your saves (`jk1/player`). Back those up first.
  If your computer won't copy folders this way, use the Files app steps above
  instead.
- **Deleting the app deletes the `jk1` folder too**, including your saves.
  Copy `jk1/player` somewhere safe first if you want to keep them.

## 4. Play

When the game files are in place, the game starts like the PC version:
the intro plays, then the main menu.

- **Menus:** tap buttons and lists the way you'd click them with a mouse.
- **Text boxes** (for example your player name): tap the box to bring up the
  keyboard.
- **Cutscenes:** tap the screen to skip.
- **The objectives screen** at the start of a level: tap *Ok*.
- The game runs in **landscape**, either way round.

The touch controls appear once you're actually playing a level, and they hide again in menus
and cutscenes.

## Touch controls

The layout looks roughly like this. Exact positions shift a little to fit your
screen, the camera cutout and the HUD.

```
 NEXT   FORCE   LIGHT  IR  BACTA         (FPS)  QUICK  QUICK  MENU
 WPN    WHEEL   (only items you have)            SAVE   LOAD
 GYRO                                              [FPS] [keyboard]
                                                   (MENU's tray, when held)

      (^^)  run marker                              JUMP   FORCE
       |                                     ACT
     ( o )  move stick: appears                            ALT
            under your left thumb         DUCK     FIRE
                                                         [ammo gauge]
```

Buttons are slightly see-through until you touch them.

### Moving and looking

- **Move:** put your left thumb down anywhere on the left side of the screen
  (a bit less than half of it). The stick appears under your thumb. Push it to walk
  forwards, backwards and sideways. It walks at the same speed however far you
  push it, and it disappears when you lift your thumb.
- **Run:** while the game's *Always Run* option is off (the default), a small
  circle with **^^** in it sits above the stick, joined to it by a line. Push
  your thumb up past the stick's ring onto that circle to **run straight
  ahead**. It lights up blue and you feel a light tap. Slide back down to walk
  again. If your thumb lands near the top of the screen, the circle sits closer
  to the stick, and if there's no room at all, there's no circle that time.
  With *Always Run* turned on (*Setup > Controls > Options*), there's no circle
  and you always run, in every direction.
- **Look / aim:** drag anywhere else on the screen, which mostly means the
  right side. Dragging on FIRE, ALT, DUCK, ACT, JUMP or FORCE also turns
  the view, so if your thumb lands on one while you're aiming, keep dragging.
- **Gyro aiming:** tap **GYRO** (top left, under NEXT WPN) to aim by turning
  the phone as well. It turns yellow while it's on, and the app remembers the
  setting next time you open it. Turn the phone left, right, up or down and
  the view follows, a bit further than the phone turns. You can still drag to
  look at the same time, for example to make big turns. Very slow movements
  count for less, so the view doesn't shake with your hands. Gyro aiming
  pauses while the Force wheel or the typing line is open. The game's mouse
  sensitivity (*Setup > Controls > Mouse*) changes how fast it turns, the
  same way it does for dragging. Think of the screen as a window: tip its
  top edge towards you to look up, away from you to look down, and turn it
  left or right as if turning your body. Left and right work the same however
  far back you tilt the phone.

### Buttons

| Button | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FIRE** | bottom right, the big one | Fires your weapon, for as long as you hold it. |
| **DUCK** | left of FIRE | Crouches while held. |
| **ACT** | up and left of FIRE | Activate: doors, switches, elevators, consoles. |
| **JUMP** | above FIRE | Jumps. |
| **ALT** | up and right of FIRE, just above the ammo gauge | Secondary fire (each weapon's second mode). |
| **FORCE** | right of JUMP | Uses your selected Force power, for as long as you hold it. Tap for a single use, hold for powers that charge up (Force Jump) or keep going (Lightning). The button shows the power's name, and it's dimmed until you have a power. The **blue ring** around it is your Force meter: it shrinks as you use the Force, and glows and pulses when the meter is full. |
| **NEXT WPN** | top left | Switches to your next weapon. |
| **FORCE WHEEL** | top left | Opens the Force wheel to choose a power: see [The Force wheel](#the-force-wheel). |
| **LIGHT**, **IR**, **BACTA** | top left, after FORCE WHEEL | Field light, IR goggles and bacta tank. Each button only appears once you have that item, and always in the same spot. LIGHT and IR turn yellow while switched on. BACTA shows how many you have when it's more than one. |
| **GYRO** | top left, under NEXT WPN | Turns gyro aiming on or off (yellow while on). Only shown on devices with a gyroscope. |
| **QUICK SAVE** | top right | **Hold** for about a third of a second: a ring fills, then the game quick saves. See [Saving and loading](#saving-and-loading). |
| **QUICK LOAD** | top right | **Hold** for a full second: a ring fills, then your quick save loads. To cancel, lift before the ring fills (sliding off doesn't cancel it). |
| **MENU** | top right corner | **Tap** opens the game's menu (objectives, map, Jedi powers, save, load, setup and more). **Hold** opens a small tray just under it, see below. |

FIRE, ALT, DUCK, ACT, JUMP, FORCE and NEXT WPN act as soon as you touch them.
LIGHT, IR, BACTA, GYRO, MENU and the tray buttons act when you **lift** your finger
on them, so if you touch one by mistake, slide off before you lift.

### MENU's tray: keyboard and FPS

Hold **MENU** until its ring fills (about half a second). A small tray opens just under it
with two buttons. Either slide your thumb down onto one and lift, or lift
first and then tap one:

- **Keyboard** (the keyboard symbol, right under MENU): opens the game's
  typing line with the iPhone keyboard, for [cheats](#cheats). While it's open,
  MENU and the keyboard button are lit yellow.
- **FPS:** shows or hides a frame-rate counter, to the left of QUICK SAVE. The app
  remembers this setting next time you open it. The FPS button is yellow while
  the counter is on.

The tray closes after you pick something, or when you touch anywhere else.
Touching MENU again just closes it. If you slide off MENU while holding it,
nothing happens.

## The Force wheel

Touch **FORCE WHEEL** to open the wheel. **The game pauses while the wheel is
open.** Every Force power always has the same slot, whether you've learned it
yet or not (powers you haven't learned are dark):

- **Left side, blue: light side.** From the top: Healing, Persuasion,
  Blinding, Absorb, Protection.
- **Across the top, gold: neutral.** From the left: Jump, Speed, Seeing, Pull.
- **Right side, red: dark side.** From the top: Throw, Grip, Lightning,
  Destruction, Deadly Sight.
- **The gap at the bottom** means *cancel*.

There are two ways to pick a power:

- **Slide (quickest):** keep your thumb down after touching FORCE WHEEL and
  slide it towards a power. A short slide in the right direction is enough,
  but you can also slide all the way onto it. The power pops out, its name
  shows in the middle, and you feel a light tick. **Lift to select it.** To
  change nothing, lift in the gap at the bottom, in the middle of the wheel,
  or back where you started.
- **Tap:** a quick tap on FORCE WHEEL (lift without sliding) leaves the wheel
  open. Then tap a power to select it. Tapping a power you haven't learned does
  nothing. Tapping anywhere else (the middle, the gap, outside the wheel, or
  FORCE WHEEL) closes the wheel without changing anything.

If you hold FORCE WHEEL without sliding and then lift, the wheel closes again
without changing anything. Once you've picked a power, use it with **FORCE**.

## Saving and loading

- **QUICK SAVE** saves to the game's quick-save slot, the same one F9 uses on PC.
  Hold it until the ring fills (about a third of a second). It saves once, while your
  finger is still down. If you lift sooner, or slide off the button, it doesn't
  save. It doesn't work while the cheat typing line is open.
- **QUICK LOAD** loads that quick save. Hold it for a full second, so a stray
  touch can't throw away your progress. To cancel, lift your finger before the
  ring fills: unlike QUICK SAVE, sliding off doesn't cancel it, and it also
  works while the typing line is open. If the quick save is from another
  level, that level is loaded. If you haven't quick saved yet, it says
  *No quicksave yet*.
- **Normal saves:** tap MENU and use the game's own save and load screens, as
  on PC.
- Your player profile and all saves are stored in *Files > On My iPhone >
  OpenJKDF2 > jk1 > player*. Copy that folder somewhere safe now and then.

## Cheats

Cheats go into the game's typing line (on PC, that's where chat goes):

1. During a level, **hold MENU** until its ring fills, then tap the
   **keyboard** button that appears just under it.
2. A typing line opens at the top of the screen, with the iPhone keyboard.
   Type the cheat (autocorrect is off here, so it goes in exactly as typed),
   then tap **return**.
3. To close the line without sending anything, tap **MENU**.

While the typing line is open, most other touch buttons don't work. The
exceptions: **FORCE WHEEL** closes the line and opens the wheel, and
**QUICK LOAD** still loads, so be careful with it. Cheats only work in single
player. Some cheats need `on` or `off` after them.

| Type this | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `jediwannabe on` / `jediwannabe off` | Invincibility on / off |
| `eriamjh` | Fly (type it again to stop) |
| `noclip` | Fly through walls (type it again to stop). This one was added by OpenJKDF2. |
| `whiteflag on` / `whiteflag off` | Turns enemy AI off / on |
| `slowmo on` / `slowmo off` | Slow motion on / off |
| `red5` | All weapons and ammo |
| `wamprat` | All items: bacta tanks, IR goggles, field light, keys and so on |
| `bactame` | Full health and shields |
| `yodajammies` | Full Force meter |
| `5858lvr` | Shows the whole level on the map (MENU > Map). Type it again to undo. |
| `imayoda` | All light side and neutral Force powers |
| `sithlord` | All dark side and neutral Force powers |
| `raccoonking` | All Force powers |
| `deeznuts` | Force level-up: sets all your Force powers (and your Jedi rank to match) to 1 star, then 2, 3 and 4 stars on each later use, then back to 1. It starts at 1 star even if you already had more, so late in the game it can make you weaker. |
| `thereisnotry` | Finishes the current level |

`imayoda`, `sithlord` and `raccoonking` also set your Jedi rank to 2 and the
powers they give to 1 star, and `imayoda` takes away any dark side powers you
have (`sithlord`: any light side powers). Late in the game they can make you
weaker, so save first.

## Settings worth knowing

All of these are in the game's own *Setup* screens (tap MENU, then Setup, or
use Setup from the main menu):

- **Always Run** (*Setup > Controls > Options*): off by default, which is why
  the stick has its run circle. Turn it on to run all the time, in every
  direction.
- **HUD Scale** (*Setup > Display*): how big the health and ammo gauges are.
  The iOS default is 2.5. Tap the box to type a new value.
- **Performance** (*Setup > Display*): if the game feels slow, try setting
  *SSAA Multiplier* below 1 (for example `0.75` or `0.5`), which draws the game
  at a lower resolution. *Enable SSAO* and *Enable Bloom* are off by default;
  if you turned them on, turn them off again. Turn on the FPS counter (MENU
  tray) to see the effect. (*Enable HiDPI* makes no difference on iOS.)
- **Look speed** (*Setup > Controls > Mouse*): there's no separate touch
  setting, but dragging to look goes into the game as mouse movement, so the
  *Sensitivity* slider for the mouse's turn and look entries should change how
  fast the view turns. This hasn't been tested on a device yet. Changing the
  sensitivity doesn't change any bindings, so it's safe (see the next point).
- **Keyboard bindings** (*Setup > Controls*): **leave these at their defaults.**
  The touch buttons press the game's default keys, so if you rebind an action,
  its touch button stops working.

## Troubleshooting

- **The app closes as soon as it opens:** its signature has probably expired
  (7 days with a free Apple ID). Refresh it in AltStore or SideStore, or install
  it again. Also check Developer Mode and "Trust" (see
  [Sign and install it](#sign-and-install-it)).
- **There's no OpenJKDF2 folder in Files:** open the app once first, so it
  creates the folder.
- **"OpenJKDF2 is missing the following required assets":** the message lists
  which files it couldn't find and the folder it looked in. Check the files
  are in `jk1/episode` and `jk1/resource`, and not one folder deeper.
- **I copied the folders into OpenJKDF2, not into jk1:** that's the "Documents
  folder" the app's message mentions. Move `Episode`, `Resource` and `MUSIC`
  into `jk1`.
- **I tapped *Install Mysteries of the Sith*:** the app now asks for the
  expansion's files. Close the app and open it again; it should start Jedi
  Knight again. You may see an empty `mots` folder next to `jk1`, which you can
  leave or delete.
- **No music:** copy the `MUSIC` folder into `jk1` (see step 1). Not every copy of the
  game includes it.
- **No cutscenes:** copy `Resource/video` too.
- **I can't see the touch buttons:** they only show while you're playing a level.
  In menus, tap the menu items directly.
- **A touch button does nothing:** if you changed the key bindings in
  *Setup > Controls*, change them back to the defaults. Also, the typing line
  might still be open: tap MENU to close it.

## Known issues and limitations

- **Experimental build.** It has only had limited testing so far. It may
  crash, and the touch layout may not suit every iPhone or iPad screen.
- **Mysteries of the Sith hasn't been tested and isn't supported.** Please
  ignore *Install Mysteries of the Sith* under *Expansions & Mods* for now.
- **No multiplayer.** The iOS build has no networking.
- **No in-app file picker.** Game files have to be copied into `jk1` with
  the Files app (or Finder / Apple Devices).
- **Not every PC key has a touch button.** There is no previous-weapon button and no direct
  weapon selection: use NEXT WPN to cycle. There is no button for the
  in-game map overlay (MENU > Map shows the map instead), and no button for
  inventory items other than field light, IR goggles and bacta.
- **The run circle only runs straight ahead.** Turn on *Always Run* if you want
  to run in every direction.
- **The touch buttons only know the default key bindings** (see
  [Settings worth knowing](#settings-worth-knowing)).
- **No separate touch look-sensitivity setting** (the mouse sensitivity may
  work instead: see *Look speed* in [Settings worth knowing](#settings-worth-knowing)).
- **Game controllers and hardware keyboards** haven't been tested with this
  build.
- **Free Apple ID signing expires every 7 days**, and deleting the app deletes
  your files and saves.

## Reporting bugs

Please report problems with this iOS build on this repository's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/sithewok13-dev/First-repo-for-Claude-for-JKDF2/issues)
(you need a free GitHub account). Please don't report them to the upstream
OpenJKDF2 project, unless the same thing also happens in the desktop version.

To help track a bug down, please include:

- your device model and iOS version, for example *iPhone 15, iOS 18.5*
- which build you're using: the release name (for example *v0.1*), or, for an
  "iOS latest build", the run number and commit from its description. (AltStore
