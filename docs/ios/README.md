## What this is

This is an **unofficial iOS build of [OpenJKDF2](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/OpenJKDF2)**,
the open-source re-implementation of the Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II engine by
shinyquagsire23 (Max Thomas) and the OpenJKDF2 contributors. Upstream OpenJKDF2
can already be built for iOS. This build adds the parts you need to actually
play it on a phone:

- on-screen touch controls (move stick, look, buttons, a Force power wheel,
  quick save and quick load), and optional tilt aiming
- a HUD that stays clear of rounded screen corners and the home bar
- sound fixes
- a ready-made (unsigned) `.ipa` that GitHub builds automatically

Please keep in mind:

- **It's experimental.** Expect bugs, and keep backups of your saves.
- **No game files are included.** You need your own copy of Jedi Knight from
  GOG or Steam. Nobody here can give you the game files, so please don't ask.
- **It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Lucasfilm, Disney or LucasArts.**
  It's also not an official OpenJKDF2 release. Please report problems with
  this build here, not to the OpenJKDF2 developers (see
  [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs)).

## What you need

- **An iPhone or iPad running iOS / iPadOS 18 or newer.** On iPhone that means an
  iPhone XS / XR or newer, including the iPhone SE (2nd generation) and later.
- **Your own copy of Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II**, installed on a
  computer, from
  [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_jedi_knight_dark_forces_ii) or
  [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/32380/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Knight_Dark_Forces_II/).
  The GOG version is a good choice: it's DRM-free and comes with the
  soundtrack as music files.
  **No Windows PC?** Both stores sell the game for Windows. On a Mac, GOG's
  offline installer (the `.exe` from your GOG library) can usually be unpacked
  with the free tool *innoextract*, but that hasn't been tested with this game.
- **A way to sideload an app** (install an app that isn't from the App Store).
  The free options need an Apple ID and, at least for setup, a Mac or Windows
  PC. See [2. Install the app](#2-install-the-app).
- **Free space on your phone** for the game files: about as much as the
  `Episode`, `Resource` and `MUSIC` folders take on your computer (check their
  size there).

**Mysteries of the Sith** (the expansion with Mara Jade) is **experimental**
on iOS: it has its own folder, `mots`, and if you have both games the app asks
which one to play when it opens. See
[Mysteries of the Sith](#mysteries-of-the-sith-experimental). Never copy
expansion files into `jk1`.

## 1. Get your game files ready

Find the folder Jedi Knight is installed in on your computer:

- **GOG:** the folder you installed the game to. In GOG Galaxy: select the
  game, open the settings menu next to Play, then *Manage installation* > *Show folder*.
- **Steam:** right-click the game in your Library, then *Manage* > *Browse local files*.

Inside it you need these folders and files. Capital letters don't matter
(`Episode` and `episode` both work), but the folder structure does:

| Folder | What's in it | Needed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `episode` | `JK1.gob`, `JK1CTF.gob`, `JK1MP.gob` | **Required** |
| `resource` | `Res1hi.gob`, `Res2.gob`, `jk_.cd` | **Required** |
| `resource/video` | the cutscenes (`.SMK` files) | Recommended: without it you get no cutscenes |
| `MUSIC` | the soundtrack (`Track12.ogg` ... `Track32.ogg` in the GOG version) | Recommended: without it there's no music. Copy it if your copy has it. |

The easiest thing is to copy the whole `Episode`, `Resource` and `MUSIC`
folders. You don't need `JK.EXE` or anything else from the game folder.

## 2. Install the app

### Download the .ipa

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/sithewok13-dev/First-repo-for-Claude-for-JKDF2/releases/latest)
and download `OpenJKDF2-iOS-unsigned.ipa` from its *Assets*. You can download it
on the phone in Safari (it goes to Files > Downloads) or on your computer,
depending on the tool you use below.

There is also an
["iOS latest build"](https://github.com/sithewok13-dev/First-repo-for-Claude-for-JKDF2/releases/tag/ios-latest)
pre-release. It's rebuilt automatically every time the code changes, so it
has the newest fixes, but it may also be broken. Use the latest release unless
you're testing a fix.

### Sign and install it

The `.ipa` is **unsigned**, and an iPhone only runs apps signed with an Apple
certificate, so you sign it yourself with a sideloading tool. Any tool that can
install your own `.ipa` file works. Some common free ones:

- **[AltStore](https://altstore.io)** (AltStore Classic). You install AltServer
  on a Mac or Windows PC and use it to put AltStore on your phone. Then in
  AltStore, go to *My Apps*, tap **+** and pick the `.ipa`. AltStore refreshes
  your apps over Wi-Fi when AltServer is running on your computer.
  (*AltStore PAL*, the EU app marketplace, is a different thing and can't
  install this file.)
- **[SideStore](https://sidestore.io)**. A version of AltStore that, after a
  one-time setup with a computer, signs and refreshes apps on the phone itself.
- **[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io)**. A Mac or Windows program: connect
  your phone, drop the `.ipa` in, sign in with your Apple ID, and it installs
  the app.

These tools ask for your **Apple ID and password**, because they sign the app
with it. They're widely used, but they're made by third parties, not Apple;
some people use a separate Apple ID just for sideloading. On Windows, AltServer
and Sideloadly also need Apple's iTunes and iCloud for Windows installed:
follow each tool's own setup instructions.

Other ways: an Apple Developer Program membership (Apple's paid account) lets you sign
apps for a year at a time, and there are third-party signing services. This
guide doesn't recommend any paid service. If you use one, it's your call
whether you trust it.

**With a free Apple ID, apps only stay signed for 7 days.** After that the app
won't open until you refresh it (AltStore and SideStore can do this for you)
or install it again with the same tool. Your game files and saves are kept
when you refresh. A free Apple ID can also only have 3 sideloaded apps
at a time (AltStore or SideStore itself counts as one).

The first time, iOS may ask for two more things:

- **Developer Mode:** go to *Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode*,
  turn it on, restart the phone, and confirm.
- **"Untrusted Developer":** go to *Settings > General > VPN & Device Management*,
  tap your Apple ID under *Developer App*, and tap *Trust*.

**Updating:** to install a newer version, sideload the new `.ipa` with the same tool and
Apple ID. It replaces the app and keeps your game files and saves. If you
switch to a different tool or Apple ID, iOS may install it as a separate
app with an empty folder. If that happens, open the new app once, copy
everything from the old app's `jk1` folder into the new app's `jk1` folder
in the Files app (see below), and only then delete the old app.

## 3. Copy the game files to your iPhone

1. **Open OpenJKDF2 once.** It will tell you the game files are missing and
   ask you to copy your installation into the app's "Documents folder", with a
   long path that ends in `Documents/jk1`. That's normal: it has just created
   its folder. In the Files app, the app's Documents folder is
   *On My iPhone > OpenJKDF2*, and your files go **one level deeper, inside
   `jk1`** (step 4). The app can't go any further without the files, so close
   it (swipe up from the bottom of the screen and swipe OpenJKDF2 away).
2. **Get the folders from step 1 onto your phone**, any way you like:
   iCloud Drive (or another cloud drive that shows up in the Files app), a USB
   stick, or a `.zip` file (for example, zip the folders on a Mac and AirDrop
   the `.zip` to your phone).
3. **Open the Files app** and go to *Browse > On My iPhone* (*On My iPad*)
   *> OpenJKDF2 > jk1*.
4. **Copy (or move) `Episode`, `Resource` and `MUSIC` into `jk1`.** For example,
   long-press a folder > *Copy*, then long-press an empty spot in `jk1` > *Paste*.
5. **Check that it looks like this**, with `episode` and `resource` directly
   inside `jk1` and not in another folder:

   ```
   On My iPhone
   └── OpenJKDF2
       └── jk1
           ├── episode
           │   ├── JK1.gob
           │   ├── JK1CTF.gob
           │   └── JK1MP.gob
           ├── resource
           │   ├── Res1hi.gob
           │   ├── Res2.gob
           │   ├── jk_.cd
           │   └── video        (cutscenes)
           └── MUSIC            (soundtrack)
   ```

   The game adds its own `player` folder (your player profile and saves),
   plus empty `mods` and `expansions` folders. Leave those alone.
6. **Open OpenJKDF2 again.**

Things to know:

- **Capital letters don't matter** for anything inside `jk1`. The game finds
  `Episode` or `episode`, and `RES2.GOB` or `Res2.gob`. But use the `jk1` folder
  the app made (all lower case). Don't make your own.
- **Using a .zip:** tapping a `.zip` in the Files app unpacks it. Unpacking can
  create an extra folder around your files. If so, move `Episode`,
  `Resource` and `MUSIC` out of it so they sit directly inside `jk1`.
- **With a cable instead:** on a Mac, open Finder, select your iPhone and go to
  the *Files* tab. On Windows, use the Apple Devices app (or iTunes) and its file sharing.
  Drag a folder named `jk1`, containing `episode`, `resource` and `MUSIC`, onto
  OpenJKDF2. If OpenJKDF2 already has a `jk1` folder, it may ask to replace
  it, and replacing it deletes your saves (`jk1/player`). Back those up first.
  If your computer won't copy folders this way, use the Files app steps above
  instead.
- **Deleting the app deletes the `jk1` folder too**, including your saves.
  Copy `jk1/player` somewhere safe first if you want to keep them.

## 4. Play

When the game files are in place, the game starts like the PC version:
the intro plays, then the main menu.

- **Menus:** tap buttons and lists the way you'd click them with a mouse.
- **Text boxes** (for example your player name): tap the box to bring up the
  keyboard.
- **Cutscenes:** tap the screen to skip.
- **The objectives screen** at the start of a level: tap *Ok*.
- The game runs in **landscape**, either way round.

The touch controls appear once you're actually playing a level, and they hide again in menus
and cutscenes.

## Mysteries of the Sith (experimental)

Mysteries of the Sith hasn't had much testing on iOS yet, so expect bugs.

1. **Open the app once** if you haven't since updating. It makes a `mots`
   folder next to `jk1` (Files > On My iPhone > OpenJKDF2 > `mots`).
2. **Copy the expansion's own `Episode`, `Resource` and `MUSIC` folders into
   `mots`**, from its install folder on your computer (the folder with
   `JKM.EXE` in it). Not the Jedi
   Knight ones: `mots/resource` needs the expansion's own `jk_.cd`, and
   `mots/episode` its `JKM*.goo` files.
3. **Open OpenJKDF2.** With both games in place, it asks **which game you want
   to play**: *Jedi Knight* or *Mysteries of the Sith*. It asks every time it
   opens, with the game you played last as the default. With only one of the
   two in place, that one starts without asking.

Each game keeps its own player profile and saves (`jk1/player`,
`mots/player`). The touch controls are the same; the Force wheel shows the
expansion's powers in its four tiers. To switch games, close the app and open
it again. The *Launch Mysteries of the Sith* entry under *Expansions & Mods*
switches without closing the app, but it hasn't been tested on iOS.

## Touch controls

The layout looks roughly like this. Exact positions shift a little to fit your
screen, the camera cutout and the HUD.

```
 NEXT   FORCE   LIGHT  IR  BACTA         (FPS)  QUICK  QUICK  MENU
 WPN    WHEEL   (only items you have)            SAVE   LOAD
 VIEW                                [SENS] [GYRO] [FPS] [keyboard]
                                     (MENU's tray, when held)

      (^^)  run marker                              JUMP   FORCE
       |                                     ACT
     ( o )  move stick: appears                            ALT
            under your left thumb         DUCK     FIRE
                                                         [ammo gauge]
```

Buttons are slightly see-through until you touch them.

### Moving and looking

- **Move:** put your left thumb down anywhere on the left side of the screen
  (a bit less than half of it). The stick appears under your thumb. Push it to walk
  forwards, backwards and sideways. It walks at the same speed however far you
  push it, and it disappears when you lift your thumb.
- **Run:** while the game's *Always Run* option is off (the default), a small
  circle with **^^** in it sits above the stick, joined to it by a line. Push
  your thumb up past the stick's ring onto that circle to **run straight
  ahead**. It lights up blue and you feel a light tap. Slide back down to walk
  again. If your thumb lands near the top of the screen, the circle sits closer
  to the stick, and if there's no room at all, there's no circle that time.
  With *Always Run* turned on (*Setup > Controls > Options*), there's no circle
  and you always run, in every direction.
- **Look / aim:** drag anywhere else on the screen, which mostly means the
  right side. Dragging on FIRE, ALT, DUCK, ACT, JUMP or FORCE also turns
  the view, so if your thumb lands on one while you're aiming, keep dragging.
  You can also aim by turning the phone: see [Tilt aiming](#tilt-aiming)
  (it starts switched off).

### Buttons

| Button | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FIRE** | bottom right, the big one | Fires your weapon, for as long as you hold it. |
| **DUCK** | left of FIRE | Crouches while held. |
| **ACT** | up and left of FIRE | Activate: doors, switches, elevators, consoles. |
| **JUMP** | above FIRE | Jumps. |
| **ALT** | up and right of FIRE, just above the ammo gauge | Secondary fire (each weapon's second mode). |
| **FORCE** | right of JUMP, or above it (a little to its left) on smaller screens with the camera cutout on the right. With Display Zoom, where there's no room there, it can sit further left, between DUCK and ACT. It always keeps a little space from the top row, so holding it can't set off QUICK SAVE or QUICK LOAD. | Uses your selected Force power, for as long as you hold it. Tap for a single use, hold for powers that charge up (Force Jump) or keep going (Lightning). The button shows the power's name, and it's dimmed until you have a power. The **blue ring** around it is your Force meter: it shrinks as you use the Force, and glows and pulses when the meter is full. |
| **NEXT WPN** | top left | **Tap:** switches to your next weapon. **Slide** or **hold:** opens the weapon wheel to choose one: see [The weapon wheel](#the-weapon-wheel). |
| **FORCE WHEEL** | top left | **Tap:** selects your next learned Force power (FORCE shows which). **Slide** or **hold:** opens the Force wheel to choose one: see [The Force wheel](#the-force-wheel). |
| **VIEW** | top left, under NEXT WPN | Switches the camera between first person and third person, like the F1 key on PC. |
| **LIGHT**, **IR**, **BACTA** | top left, after FORCE WHEEL | Field light, IR goggles and bacta tank. Each button only appears once you have that item, and always in the same spot. LIGHT and IR turn yellow while switched on. BACTA shows how many you have when it's more than one. |
| **QUICK SAVE** | top right | **Hold** for about a third of a second: a ring fills, then the game quick saves. See [Saving and loading](#saving-and-loading). |
| **QUICK LOAD** | top right | **Hold** for about a third of a second: a ring fills, then your quick save loads. To cancel, lift or slide off before the ring fills. |
| **MENU** | top right corner | **Tap** opens the game's menu (objectives, map, Jedi powers, save, load, setup and more). **Hold** opens a small tray just under it, see below. |

FIRE, ALT, DUCK, ACT, JUMP, FORCE and VIEW act as soon as you touch them.
LIGHT, IR, BACTA, MENU and the tray buttons act when you **lift** your finger
on them, so if you touch one by mistake, slide off before you lift. NEXT WPN
and FORCE WHEEL act on a quick tap when you lift, or open their wheel when
you slide or hold (see [Tap, slide or hold](#tap-slide-or-hold)).

### MENU's tray: tilt aiming, FPS and keyboard

Hold **MENU** until its ring fills (about half a second). A small tray opens just under it
with four buttons, from left to right **SENS**, **GYRO**, **FPS** and the
**keyboard**. Either slide your thumb down onto one and lift, or lift first and
then tap one. Anywhere on the tray's dark backing counts as the nearest button.

- **SENS** and **GYRO:** tilt aiming's sensitivity and setting, see
  [Tilt aiming](#tilt-aiming). Each tap goes on to the next setting, and the
  tray stays open, so you can tap again.
- **FPS:** shows or hides a frame-rate counter, to the left of QUICK SAVE. The FPS
  button is yellow while the counter is on.
- **Keyboard** (the keyboard symbol, at the right end of the tray): opens the
  game's typing line with the iPhone keyboard, for [cheats](#cheats). While
  it's open, MENU and the keyboard button are lit yellow.

The app remembers SENS, GYRO and FPS next time you open it. The tray usually
sits right under MENU. On smaller screens (with the camera cutout on the
right, with Display Zoom, or at a large HUD Scale) it sits further left, so
that it never covers FORCE or the buttons around FIRE. The tray closes after
you pick FPS or the keyboard, or when you touch anywhere else. Touching MENU
again just closes it. If you slide off MENU while holding it, nothing happens.

## Tilt aiming

You can also aim by turning and tilting the iPhone, on top of dragging. **Tilt
aiming starts switched off.** To switch it on, hold **MENU** and tap **GYRO**
in its tray. Each tap goes on to the next setting:

- **GYRO OFF** (the default): no tilt aiming. The app doesn't read the
  motion sensor at all.
- **GYRO TOUCH:** turning the phone aims while either thumb is touching the
  game: your left thumb on the move stick (even resting there without moving),
  or your right thumb on the look area (resting or dragging) or on FIRE, ALT,
  DUCK, ACT, JUMP or FORCE. So while your left thumb is on the stick, moving
  your right thumb from the look area to FIRE doesn't interrupt aiming, and
  while you walk, turning the phone always aims. To move the phone back to a
  comfortable position, lift both thumbs: the view stays exactly where it is,
  and when you touch again it carries on from there, like lifting a mouse off
  the desk. The buttons along the top (NEXT WPN, FORCE WHEEL, QUICK SAVE, MENU
  and the rest) don't count.
- **GYRO ALWAYS:** turning the phone always aims, with or without a thumb down.

**SENS** sets how far the view turns: 1.0x, 1.5x (the default), 2.0x or 3.0x.
At 1.0x the view turns exactly as far as the phone does. SENS is dimmed while
GYRO is off. GYRO is lit yellow while tilt aiming is on.

Good to know:

- **The view never resets or springs back.** Tilt aiming only adds the way
  the phone turns. There's no "straight ahead" position it returns to, so
  however you hold the phone when you start, that's where you start from.
- Turning left and right works however far back you tip the phone, even lying
  flat on a table. It also works lying down with the screen facing you from
  above, or on your side. Tilting the top of the phone toward you looks up.
- Tilt aiming pauses while the Force wheel or the weapon wheel, the cheat typing line or MENU's
  tray is open, and for a moment after you turn the phone round to the other
  landscape side.
- The game's mouse sensitivity (*Setup > Controls > Mouse*) doesn't change it.
  Use SENS instead.
- If the device has no motion sensor, GYRO says **NO GYRO** and does nothing.

## The Force wheel

**FORCE WHEEL** opens the Force wheel (see [Tap, slide or hold](#tap-slide-or-hold)
for the three ways to use the button). **The game pauses while the wheel is
open.** Every Force power always has the same slot, whether you've learned it
yet or not (powers you haven't learned are dark):

- **Left side, blue: light side.** From the top: Healing, Persuasion,
  Blinding, Absorb, Protection.
- **Across the top, gold: neutral.** From the left: Jump, Speed, Seeing, Pull.
- **Right side, red: dark side.** From the top: Throw, Grip, Lightning,
  Destruction, Deadly Sight.
- **The gap at the bottom** means *cancel*.

**Stars:** under the name of each power you've learned, a row of four stars
shows its level, one gold star per level (a power at level 2 shows two gold
stars and two empty ones).

Once you've picked a power, use it with **FORCE**.

### Tap, slide or hold

FORCE WHEEL and NEXT WPN work the same way. Each has three gestures:

- **Quick tap** (lift within about a third of a second, without sliding):
  FORCE WHEEL selects your **next learned Force power**, skipping the ones you
  haven't learned (the FORCE button shows which one you have now). NEXT WPN
  switches to your **next weapon**. No wheel opens.
- **Touch and slide (quickest):** as soon as your thumb slides away from the
  button, the wheel opens. Keep sliding towards a slot. A short slide in the
  right direction is enough, but you can also slide all the way onto it. The
  slot pops out, its name shows in the middle, and you feel a light tick.
  **Lift to select it.** To change nothing, lift in the gap at the bottom, in
  the middle of the wheel, or back where you started. A slide too short to
  point at anything leaves the wheel open for tapping.
- **Touch and hold still** for about a third of a second: a ring fills round
  the button, and the wheel opens and **stays open**. Lift, then tap a slot to
  select it. (Or, without lifting, slide your thumb out from the button to
  pick by sliding after all.)

With the wheel open for tapping: tap a slot to select it. Tapping a power you
haven't learned, or a weapon you can't switch to, does nothing. Tapping
anywhere else (the middle, the gap, outside the wheel, or either button at the
top left) closes the wheel without changing anything.

## The weapon wheel

**NEXT WPN** opens the weapon wheel when you slide or hold it (a quick tap
switches to the next weapon, as before). It works like the Force wheel (see
[Tap, slide or hold](#tap-slide-or-hold)), and **the game pauses while it is
open** too.

Every weapon always has the same slot, whether you've found it yet or not, in
the order of the number keys on PC, clockwise from the bottom left: Fists,
Bryar Pistol, Stormtrooper Rifle, Thermal Detonator, Bowcaster, Repeater,
Rail Detonator, Sequencer Charge, Concussion Rifle, Lightsaber. The gap at the
bottom means *cancel*. The colours show the kind of ammo: gold for the fists
and the lightsaber (no ammo), blue for energy cells, green for power cells and
red for explosives.

- **Under each weapon you have, its ammo count** shows: the same number the
  HUD shows with that weapon in hand (energy cells for the Bryar and the
  rifle; power cells for the bowcaster, repeater and concussion rifle; rail
  charges for the rail detonator; how many thermal detonators and sequencer
  charges you're carrying). Weapons that share ammo show the same number. The
  fists and the lightsaber show no count.
- **Weapons you haven't found yet are dark**, with no count.
- **A weapon you have but can't fire is greyed**, with its count (usually
  **0**), and can't be selected. The bowcaster needs more than 1 power cell
  and the concussion rifle more than 7, as in the game, so they can be greyed
  at 1 or 7. Thermal detonators and sequencer charges are their own ammo: when
  you have none left they show as not found.
- The weapon in hand has a white edge.

If you pick a weapon while the game is still switching weapons (just after a
switch), it switches as soon as the game is ready, within a second or so. That
includes the weapon you're putting away: pick it to switch straight back. A
quick load drops a pick that is still waiting.

## Saving and loading

- **QUICK SAVE** saves to the game's quick-save slot, the same one F9 uses on PC.
  Hold it until the ring fills (about a third of a second). It saves once, while your
  finger is still down. If you lift sooner, or slide off the button, it doesn't
  save, even if you slide back on. It doesn't work while the cheat typing line
  is open.
- **QUICK LOAD** loads that quick save. Hold it until the ring fills (about a
  third of a second), so a stray tap can't throw away your progress. It loads
  once, while your finger is still down. If you lift sooner, or slide off the
  button, it doesn't load, even if you slide back on. It doesn't work while the
  cheat typing line is open. If the quick save is from another level, that
  level is loaded. If you haven't quick saved yet, it says *No quicksave yet*.
- **Holding with more than one finger** still saves or loads only once. To do
  it again, touch and hold the button again. If you press QUICK SAVE and QUICK
  LOAD together, only the one whose ring fills first goes off (if both fill in
  the same frame, it saves).
- **Normal saves:** tap MENU and use the game's own save and load screens, as
  on PC.
- Your player profile and all saves are stored in *Files > On My iPhone >
  OpenJKDF2 > jk1 > player*. Copy that folder somewhere safe now and then.

## Cheats

Cheats go into the game's typing line (on PC, that's where chat goes):

1. During a level, **hold MENU** until its ring fills, then tap the
   **keyboard** button at the right end of the tray that appears under it.
2. A typing line opens at the top of the screen, with the iPhone keyboard.
   Type the cheat (autocorrect is off here, so it goes in exactly as typed),
   then tap **return**.
3. To close the line without sending anything, tap **MENU**.

While the typing line is open, most other touch buttons don't work. The
exceptions: **MENU** (and the tray's keyboard button) close the line, and
**FORCE WHEEL** and **NEXT WPN** close it and open their wheel when you
slide or hold them (a quick tap does nothing while you type). Cheats only work in single
player. Some cheats need `on` or `off` after them.

| Type this | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `jediwannabe on` / `jediwannabe off` | Invincibility on / off |
| `eriamjh` | Fly (type it again to stop) |
| `noclip` | Fly through walls (type it again to stop). This one was added by OpenJKDF2. |
| `whiteflag on` / `whiteflag off` | Turns enemy AI off / on |
| `slowmo on` / `slowmo off` | Slow motion on / off |
| `red5` | All weapons and ammo |
| `wamprat` | All items: bacta tanks, IR goggles, field light, keys and so on |
| `bactame` | Full health and shields |
| `yodajammies` | Full Force meter |
| `5858lvr` | Shows the whole level on the map (MENU > Map). Type it again to undo. |
| `imayoda` | All light side and neutral Force powers |
| `sithlord` | All dark side and neutral Force powers |
| `raccoonking` | All Force powers |
| `deeznuts` | Force level-up: sets all your Force powers (and your Jedi rank to match) to 1 star, then 2, 3 and 4 stars on each later use, then back to 1. It starts at 1 star even if you already had more, so late in the game it can make you weaker. |
| `thereisnotry` | Finishes the current level |

`imayoda`, `sithlord` and `raccoonking` also set your Jedi rank to 2 and the
powers they give to 1 star, and `imayoda` takes away any dark side powers you
have (`sithlord`: any light side powers). Late in the game they can make you
weaker, so save first.

## Settings worth knowing

All of these are in the game's own *Setup* screens (tap MENU, then Setup, or
use Setup from the main menu):

- **Always Run** (*Setup > Controls > Options*): off by default, which is why
  the stick has its run circle. Turn it on to run all the time, in every
  direction.
- **HUD Scale** (*Setup > Display*): how big the health and ammo gauges are.
  The iOS default is 2.5. Tap the box to type a new value.
- **Performance** (*Setup > Display*): if the game feels slow, try setting
  *SSAA Multiplier* below 1 (for example `0.75` or `0.5`), which draws the game
  at a lower resolution. *Enable SSAO* and *Enable Bloom* are off by default;
  if you turned them on, turn them off again. Turn on the FPS counter (MENU
  tray) to see the effect. (*Enable HiDPI* makes no difference on iOS.)
- **Look speed** (*Setup > Controls > Mouse*): there's no separate touch
  setting, but dragging to look goes into the game as mouse movement, so the
  *Sensitivity* slider for the mouse's turn and look entries should change how
  fast the view turns. This hasn't been tested on a device yet. Changing the
  sensitivity doesn't change any bindings, so it's safe (see the next point).
  Tilt aiming has its own setting, SENS, in MENU's tray (see
  [Tilt aiming](#tilt-aiming)).
- **Keyboard bindings** (*Setup > Controls*): **leave these at their defaults.**
  The touch buttons press the game's default keys, so if you rebind an action,
  its touch button stops working.

## Troubleshooting

- **The app closes as soon as it opens:** its signature has probably expired
  (7 days with a free Apple ID). Refresh it in AltStore or SideStore, or install
  it again. Also check Developer Mode and "Trust" (see
  [Sign and install it](#sign-and-install-it)).
- **There's no OpenJKDF2 folder in Files:** open the app once first, so it
  creates the folder.
- **"OpenJKDF2 is missing the following required assets":** the message lists
  which files it couldn't find and the folder it looked in. Check the files
  are in `jk1/episode` and `jk1/resource`, and not one folder deeper.
- **I copied the folders into OpenJKDF2, not into jk1:** that's the "Documents
  folder" the app's message mentions. Move `Episode`, `Resource` and `MUSIC`
  into `jk1`.
- **I tapped *Install Mysteries of the Sith*:** if the expansion's files
  aren't in `mots` yet, the app asks for them. Close the app and open it again;
  it starts Jedi Knight. The `mots` folder next to `jk1` is where the
  expansion's files go (see
  [Mysteries of the Sith](#mysteries-of-the-sith-experimental)); leave it
  empty if you don't have it.
- **The app doesn't ask which game to play:** it only asks when both `jk1`
  and `mots` have their game's files. Check that `mots/resource/jk_.cd` is
  the expansion's own, not a copy of Jedi Knight's.
- **No music:** copy the `MUSIC` folder into `jk1` (see step 1). Not every copy of the
  game includes it.
- **No cutscenes:** copy `Resource/video` too.
- **I can't see the touch buttons:** they only show while you're playing a level.
  In menus, tap the menu items directly.
- **The view turns when I move the phone:** tilt aiming is on. Hold MENU and
  tap GYRO until it says GYRO OFF, or choose GYRO TOUCH so it only aims while
  a thumb is on the move stick, on the look area or on the buttons around FIRE
  (see [Tilt aiming](#tilt-aiming)).
- **Tilt aiming stops for a moment when I move my right thumb to FIRE (GYRO
  TOUCH):** keep your left thumb on the move stick. Tilt aiming then carries on
  while your right thumb is in the air. It only stops when both thumbs are up.
- **A touch button does nothing:** if you changed the key bindings in
  *Setup > Controls*, change them back to the defaults. Also, the typing line
  might still be open: tap MENU to close it.

## Known issues and limitations

- **Experimental build.** It has only had limited testing so far. It may
  crash, and the touch layout may not suit every iPhone or iPad screen.
- **Mysteries of the Sith is experimental.** It has had little testing on
  iOS. Switching games from *Expansions & Mods* without closing the app hasn't
  been tested at all.
- **No multiplayer.** The iOS build has no networking.
- **No in-app file picker.** Game files have to be copied into `jk1` with
  the Files app (or Finder / Apple Devices).
- **Not every PC key has a touch button.** There is no previous-weapon or
  previous-power button: use the weapon and Force wheels (NEXT WPN and FORCE
  WHEEL). There is no button for the
  in-game map overlay (MENU > Map shows the map instead), and no button for
  inventory items other than field light, IR goggles and bacta.
- **The run circle only runs straight ahead.** Turn on *Always Run* if you want
  to run in every direction.
- **The touch buttons only know the default key bindings** (see
  [Settings worth knowing](#settings-worth-knowing)).
- **No separate touch look-sensitivity setting** (the mouse sensitivity may
  work instead: see *Look speed* in [Settings worth knowing](#settings-worth-knowing)).
- **Game controllers and hardware keyboards** haven't been tested with this
  build.
- **Free Apple ID signing expires every 7 days**, and deleting the app deletes
  your files and saves.

## Reporting bugs

Please report problems with this iOS build on this repository's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/sithewok13-dev/First-repo-for-Claude-for-JKDF2/issues)
(you need a free GitHub account). Please don't report them to the upstream
OpenJKDF2 project, unless the same thing also happens in the desktop version.

To help track a bug down, please include:

- your device model and iOS version, for example *iPhone 15, iOS 18.5*
- which build you're using: the release name (for example *v0.1*), or, for an
  "iOS latest build", the run number and commit from its description. (AltStore
  and Settings show the app's version as 0.9.9: that's the engine's version,
  not the release name.)
- what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead, plus the
  level and roughly where in it, if that matters
- a screenshot or a screen recording, if you can
- whether you copied the cutscenes and music, and whether you changed any
  settings

Please don't attach any of the game's own files.
